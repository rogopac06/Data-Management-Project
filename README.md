# Data-Management-Project
## Project for the Data Management Course - MSc Data Science UNIMIB

### The goal of this project is to create a dataset of reddit's financial subreddits posts in order to investigate possible correlations between stock prices movements and retail sentiment on social media.

The focus of this course project is to build the dataset using different tools ranging from scraping to API, possibly avoiding direct downloading from sources.
It also focuses on the correct database choice based on the type of data; in our case we opted for MongoDB, a NoSQL db which is extremely versatile. 

This roadmap highligths the projects main steps:

1) Stocks data acquistion (via stocks_info and yahoo_fin API)
3) Reddit posts acquisition (via praw and pmaw API)
4) upload on MongoDB 
5) Data integration
